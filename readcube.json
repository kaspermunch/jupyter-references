Martin"],"chapter":null,"journal":"Cytogenetic and Genome Research","abstract":"During meiosis, homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis are essential for subsequent meiotic recombination (crossing-over). Discontinuous regions (gaps) and unsynapsed regions (splits) were most frequently observed in the heterochromatic regions of bivalent synaptonemal complex (SC) 9, and we have previously demonstrated that gaps and splits significantly altered the distribution of MLH1 recombination foci on SC 9. Here, immunofluorescence techniques (using antibodies against SC proteins and the crossover-associated MLH1 protein) were combined with a centromere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization technique that allows identification of every individual chromosome. The effect of gaps/splits on meiotic recombination patterns in autosomes other than chromosome 9 during the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase was then examined in 6,026 bivalents from 262 pachytene cells from three human males. In 64 analyzed cells with a gapped SC 9, the frequency of MLH1 foci in SCs 5 and 10 and in SC arms 10q, 11p and 16q was decreased compared to 168 analyzed cells with a normally-synapsed SC 9 (controls). In 24 analyzed cells with splits in SC 9, there was a significant reduction in MLH1 focus frequency for SC 5q and the whole SC5 bivalent. The positioning of MLH1 foci on other SCs in cells with gapped/split SC 9 was not altered. These studies suggest that gaps and splits not only have a cis effect, but may also have a trans effect on meiotic recombination in humans.","pagination":"27-32","journal_abbrev":"Cytogenet Genome Res"},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1159/000109615","pmid":"18160778"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"tags":[],"notes":null,"source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"Sun:2007ff3","created":"2018-11-05T12:47:37Z","modified":"2020-03-19T18:38:55Z","createdby":"Web App Preview","last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop-MacOS10.15.3-2.33.14531","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":0,"active_read_time":null,"has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{"type":"article"},"id":"f6611950-267b-446a-a4c6-a6922c6167a4","type":"item","access_data":{}},{"seq":18603,"files":[],"article":{"isbn":null,"issn":"1061-4036","year":2006,"eisbn":null,"eissn":null,"issue":null,"title":"Genome variation and evolution of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum","volume":"39","authors":["Daniel C Jeffares","Arnab Pain","Andrew Berry","Anthony V Cox","James Stalker","Catherine E Ingle","Alan Thomas","Michael A Quail","Kyle Siebenthall","Anne-Catrin Uhlemann","Sue Kyes","Sanjeev Krishna","Chris Newbold","Emmanouil T Dermitzakis","Matthew Berriman"],"chapter":null,"journal":"Nature Genetics","abstract":null,"pagination":null},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1038/ng1931"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"added":null,"notes":null,"source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1038/ng1931","created":"2015-08-13T08:06:07Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:43:02Z","createdby":null,"last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":1,"active_read_time":"0","has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"data_version":1,"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{},"id":"4c96c674-a999-850b-87df-0b518101cb6b","type":"item","access_data":{}},{"seq":18607,"files":[],"article":{"isbn":null,"issn":"0016-6731","year":1988,"eisbn":null,"eissn":null,"issue":"3","title":"The coalescent process in models with selection and recombination.","volume":"120","authors":["RR Hudson","NL Kaplan"],"chapter":null,"journal":"Genetics","abstract":"The statistical properties of the process describing the genealogical history of a random sample of genes at a selectively neutral locus which is linked to a locus at which natural selection operates are investigated.

Thus, the statistical properties of the genealogical process for a random sample at a neutral locus linked to a locus with selection follow from the results obtained for the selected locus. Sequence data from the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) region of Drosophila melanogaster are examined and compared to predictions based on the theory. It is found that the spatial distribution of nucleotide differences between Fast and Slow alleles of Adh is very similar to the spatial distribution predicted if balancing selection operates to maintain the allozyme variation at the Adh locus. The spatial distribution of nucleotide differences between different Slow alleles of Adh do not match the predictions of this simple model very well.","pagination":"831-40"},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"pmc":"PMC1203560","pmid":3147214,"pmcid":"PMC1203560"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"added":null,"notes":null,"source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"wdq","created":"2015-08-13T08:06:07Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:43:03Z","createdby":null,"last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":1,"active_read_time":"0","has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"data_version":1,"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{},"id":"11f9e268-9ef1-c357-a3f9-6de8a148ba92","type":"item","access_data":{}},{"seq":18619,"files":[],"article":{"isbn":null,"issn":"0378-1119","year":2005,"eisbn":null,"eissn":null,"issue":null,"title":"Gene splice sites correlate with nucleosome positions","volume":"352","authors":["Simon Kogan","Edward N Trifonov"],"chapter":null,"journal":"Gene","abstract":null,"pagination":null},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1016/j.gene.2005.03.004"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"added":null,"notes":null,"source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1016/j.gene.2005.03.004","created":"2015-08-13T08:06:07Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:43:04Z","createdby":null,"last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":1,"active_read_time":"0","has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"data_version":1,"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{},"id":"0f8789dd-2304-fe8d-ac83-0b51817f9dfe","type":"item","access_data":{}},{"seq":18623,"files":[],"article":{"isbn":null,"issn":"1471-2105","year":2008,"eisbn":null,"eissn":null,"issue":null,"title":"nGASP - the nematode genome annotation assessment project","volume":"9","authors":["Avril Coghlan","Tristan J Fiedler","Sheldon J McKay","Paul Flicek","Todd W Harris","Darin Blasiar","The Consortium","Lincoln D Stein"],"chapter":null,"journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","abstract":null,"pagination":null},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1186/1471-2105-9-549"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"added":null,"notes":null,"source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1186/1471-2105-9-549","created":"2015-08-13T08:06:07Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:43:04Z","createdby":null,"last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":1,"active_read_time":"0","has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"data_version":1,"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{},"id":"e471d1de-ba18-91f4-b826-0b51814f8285","type":"item","access_data":{}},{"seq":18641,"files":[],"article":{"isbn":null,"issn":"1553-7390","year":2006,"eisbn":null,"eissn":null,"issue":null,"title":"Discordance of Species Trees with Their Most Likely Gene Trees","volume":"2","authors":["James H Degnan","Noah A Rosenberg"],"chapter":null,"journal":"PLoS Genetics","abstract":null,"pagination":null},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.0020068"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"added":null,"notes":null,"source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1371/journal.pgen.0020068","created":"2015-08-13T08:06:07Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:43:06Z","createdby":null,"last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":1,"active_read_time":"0","has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"data_version":1,"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{},"id":"a6771c9a-78d1-a6f5-7f87-0b5182fda8b5","type":"item","access_data":{}},{"seq":18654,"files":[],"article":{"isbn":null,"issn":"0036-8075","year":2009,"eisbn":null,"eissn":null,"issue":"5960","title":"Evolution.

local haplotype homozygosity represents a powerful strategy to characterize candidate genes responding to natural or artificial positive selection. To that end, statistics measuring the extent of haplotype homozygosity within (e.g. EHH, iHS) and between (Rsb or XP-EHH) populations have been proposed in the literature. The rehh package for r was previously developed to facilitate genome-wide scans of selection, based on the analysis of long-range haplotypes. However, its performance was not sufficient to cope with the growing size of available data sets. Here, we propose a major upgrade of the rehh package, which includes an improved processing of the input files, a faster algorithm to enumerate haplotypes, as well as multithreading. As illustrated with the analysis of large human haplotype data sets, these improvements decrease the computation time by more than one order of magnitude. This new version of rehh will thus allow performing iHS-, Rsb- or XP-EHH-based scans on large data sets. The package rehh 2.0 is available from the CRAN repository (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rehh/index.html) together with help files and a detailed manual.","pagination":null},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1111/1755-0998.12634","pmid":"27863062"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"tags":[],"notes":null,"source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1111/1755-0998.12634","created":"2019-02-01T16:48:42Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:26Z","createdby":"Mobile-iPad7,112.1-2.60.2.60002","last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":0,"active_read_time":null,"has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{"type":"article"},"id":"f283e5e3-3ca5-42a5-9286-4b11496c7ca2","type":"item","access_data":{},"pdf_hash":"b0538fc51540b30330442d28e3349d80959c20ce44a3f3c16afe7a99897a8dbf","primary_file_type":"pdf","primary_file_hash":"b0538fc51540b30330442d28e3349d80959c20ce44a3f3c16afe7a99897a8dbf"},{"seq":19565,"files":[{"name":"62633765326262332d316139342d346162322d616231622d376130396563343133336338.pdf","sha1":"0b9e707ff36715a0f63135ef15f63a922a131f97","size":1472067,"type":"article","pages":7,"width":"594.000","height":"756.000","sha256":"25d95b0bc8f656f534cef3a874e8f81e9e8b2c0411c0bd14f0ec4f22b58c40d8","created":"2019-03-20T19:29:19Z","expires":null,"file_type":"pdf","source_url":null,"customWidth":{"0-6":"594.000"},"customHeight":{"0-6":"756.000"},"access_method":null,"manually_matched":false}],"article":{"url":"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6213/1113.abstract","isbn":null,"issn":"0036-8075","year":2014,"eisbn":null,"eissn":"1095-9203","issue":"6213","month":11,"title":"Genomic structure in Europeans dating back at least 36,200 years","volume":"346","authors":["Andaine Seguin-Orlando","Thorfinn S Korneliussen","Martin Sikora","Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas","Andrea Manica","Ida Moltke","Anders Albrechtsen","Amy Ko","Ashot Margaryan","Vyacheslav Moiseyev","Ted Goebel","Michael Westaway","David Lambert","Valeri Khartanovich","Jeffrey D Wall","Philip R Nigst","Robert A Foley","Marta Lahr","Rasmus Nielsen","Ludovic Orlando","Eske Willerslev"],"chapter":null,"journal":"Science","pdf_url":"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6213/1113.full.pdf","abstract":"The origin of contemporary Europeans remains contentious.

We find that Kostenki 14 shares a close ancestry with the 24,000-year-old Mal’ta boy from central Siberia, European Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, some contemporary western Siberians, and many Europeans, but not eastern Asians. Additionally, the Kostenki 14 genome shows evidence of shared ancestry with a population basal to all Eurasians that also relates to later European Neolithic farmers. We find that Kostenki 14 contains more Neandertal DNA that is contained in longer tracts than present Europeans. Our findings reveal the timing of divergence of western Eurasians and East Asians to be more than 36,200 years ago and that European genomic structure today dates back to the Upper Paleolithic and derives from a metapopulation that at times stretched from Europe to central Asia.","pagination":"1113-1118"},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1126/science.aaa0114","pmid":"25378462"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"tags":[],"notes":null,"source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1126/science.aaa0114","created":"2019-03-20T19:29:19Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:27Z","createdby":"Mobile-iPad7,112.1-2.61.2.61005","last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":0,"active_read_time":null,"has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{"type":"article"},"id":"bc7e2bb3-1a94-4ab2-ab1b-7a09ec4133c8","type":"item","access_data":{},"pdf_hash":"25d95b0bc8f656f534cef3a874e8f81e9e8b2c0411c0bd14f0ec4f22b58c40d8","primary_file_type":"pdf","primary_file_hash":"25d95b0bc8f656f534cef3a874e8f81e9e8b2c0411c0bd14f0ec4f22b58c40d8"},{"seq":19569,"files":[{"name":"30623664613436642d666165302d343830392d613938312d333730666433666232316633.pdf","sha1":"4a72865cb079faccbd0ee2ddc3b010ba57bc20b6","size":386848,"type":"article","pages":12,"width":"607.465","height":"790.299","sha256":"618b3de69b5fc3df51f8188ea4ee61712126b65340cf4fbd3c7e73c5f2863070","created":"2019-01-12T11:35:41Z","expires":null,"file_type":"pdf","source_url":null,"customWidth":{"0-11":"607.465"},"customHeight":{"0-11":"790.299"},"access_method":null,"manually_matched":false}],"article":{"url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01028.x/abstract","isbn":null,"issn":"1558-5646","year":2010,"eisbn":null,"eissn":null,"issue":"10","title":"X‐AUTOSOME INCOMPATIBILITIES IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER: TESTS OF HALDANE'S RULE AND GEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS WITHIN SPECIES","volume":"64","authors":["Joseph Lachance","John R True"],"chapter":null,"journal":"Evolution","pdf_url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01028.x/pdf","abstract":"Substantial genetic variation exists in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. This segregating variation includes alleles at different loci that interact to cause lethality or sterility (synthetic incompatibilities). Fitness epistasis in natural populations has important implications for speciation and the rate of adaptive evolution. To assess the prevalence of epistatic fitness interactions, we placed naturally occurring X chromosomes into genetic backgrounds derived from different geographic locations. Considerable amounts of synthetic incompatibilities were observed between X chromosomes and autosomes: greater than 44% of all combinations were either lethal or sterile. Sex-specific lethality and sterility were also tested to determine whether Haldane's rule holds for within-species variation. Surprisingly, we observed an excess of female sterility in genotypes that were homozygous, but not heterozygous, for the X chromosome. The recessive nature of these incompatibilities is similar to that predicted for incompatibilities underlying Haldane's rule. Our study also found higher levels of sterility and lethality for genomes that contain chromosomes from different geographical regions. These findings are consistent with the view that genomes are coadapted gene complexes and that geography affects the likelihood of epistatic fitness interactions.","pagination":null},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01028.x","pmid":"20455929"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"tags":[],"notes":null,"source":null,"unread":false,"citekey":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01028.x","created":"2019-01-12T11:35:41Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:27Z","createdby":"Mobile-iPhone9,312.1-2.60.2.60002","last_read":"2019-04-04T07:01:18Z","modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":1,"annotations":[],"print_count":0,"sourced_from":0,"active_read_time":null,"has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":"2019-04-04T07:01:18Z","view_count_total":1},"import_data":{},"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{"type":"article"},"id":"0b6da46d-fae0-4809-a981-370fd3fb21f3","type":"item","access_data":{},"pdf_hash":"618b3de69b5fc3df51f8188ea4ee61712126b65340cf4fbd3c7e73c5f2863070","primary_file_type":"pdf","primary_file_hash":"618b3de69b5fc3df51f8188ea4ee61712126b65340cf4fbd3c7e73c5f2863070"},{"drm":null,"seq":19584,"files":[{"name":"The Deubiquitylating Enzyme USP4 Cooperates with CtIP in DNA Double-Strand Break End Resection.pdf","sha1":null,"size":4225922,"type":"article","pages":16,"width":null,"height":null,"sha256":"d8096b3112ad72af8e3a04fd02a78a777f36018cfbb87b111abfeffe1745f350","created":"2019-05-15T13:46:09Z","expires":null,"file_type":"pdf","source_url":null,"customWidth":null,"customHeight":null,"access_method":"open_access","manually_matched":false},{"name":null,"sha1":null,"size":4028323,"type":"supplement","pages":4,"width":null,"height":null,"sha256":"6d277f76de1c30255c38f13e50ed703226f5e06b25486a4264603e82b987d966","created":"2019-05-15T13:46:09Z","expires":null,"file_type":"pdf","source_url":null,"customWidth":null,"customHeight":null,"access_method":"official_supplement","manually_matched":false}],"article":{"isbn":null,"issn":"2211-1247","year":2015,"eisbn":null,"eissn":"2211-1247","issue":"1","title":"The Deubiquitylating Enzyme USP4 Cooperates with CtIP in DNA Double-Strand Break End Resection","volume":"13","authors":["Hailong Liu","Haoxing Zhang","Xiaohui Wang","Qingsong Tian","Zhaohua Hu","Changmin Peng","Pei Jiang","TingTing Wang","Wei Guo","Yali Chen","Xinzhi Li","Pumin Zhang","Huadong Pei"],"chapter":null,"journal":"Cell Reports","abstract":"DNA end resection is a highly regulated and critical step in DNA double-stranded break (DSB) repair.

Thus, ARF-BP1 emerges as a novel therapeutic target against cancer regardless of p53 status.","pagination":"1555","journal_abbrev":"Brit J Cancer"},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1038/sj.bjc.6603119","pmid":"16641901"},"item_type":"article","purchased":null,"user_data":{"star":false,"tags":[],"notes":null,"source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1038/sj.bjc.6603119","created":"2019-05-29T08:05:54Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:29Z","createdby":"aa_extension-chrome-v2.13","last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":0,"active_read_time":null,"has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{"type":"article"},"id":"789eaf7f-e62b-425c-aa96-7d502cfcc2c3","type":"item","access_data":{},"pdf_hash":"3f7b9180c5d709c975aa6a94e19d8e9459c3b98c7180cbb0dcf73ff10120f2df","primary_file_type":"pdf","primary_file_hash":"3f7b9180c5d709c975aa6a94e19d8e9459c3b98c7180cbb0dcf73ff10120f2df"},{"drm":null,"seq":19617,"files":[{"name":"www.nature.com 8/30/2019, 1:49:36 PM.pdf","sha1":null,"size":1643744,"type":"article","pages":15,"width":null,"height":null,"sha256":"90f4d72056d449808f77f78fe22fd548ef7588924123c8bff1bf41b19eb74988","created":"2019-08-30T11:49:37Z","expires":null,"file_type":"pdf","source_url":null,"customWidth":null,"customHeight":null,"access_method":"personal_library","manually_matched":false},{"name":null,"sha1":null,"size":3495542,"type":"supplement","pages":49,"width":null,"height":null,"sha256":"e45a0eb49b8b58ef0ab0af4b0f193dad818075e03f545d6e864466bc14436314","created":"2019-08-30T11:49:37Z","expires":null,"file_type":"pdf","source_url":null,"customWidth":null,"customHeight":null,"access_method":"official_supplement","manually_matched":false},{"name":null,"sha1":null,"size":618229,"type":"supplement","pages":45,"width":null,"height":null,"sha256":"f8edb8345ed8d090d3138ddc6e968007211b1b2ded9b870cb6c1b6c80ed84722","created":"2019-08-30T11:49:37Z","expires":null,"file_type":"pdf","source_url":null,"customWidth":null,"customHeight":null,"access_method":"official_supplement","manually_matched":false},{"name":null,"sha1":null,"size":124213,"type":"supplement","pages":2,"width":null,"height":null,"sha256":"accf53a767948be1afa095bd5fa9ce2eed4481c66a9b09d036d228a0c4c03dbd","created":"2019-08-30T11:49:37Z","expires":null,"file_type":"pdf","source_url":null,"customWidth":null,"customHeight":null,"access_method":"official_supplement","manually_matched":false},{"name":null,"sha1":null,"size":99627,"type":"supplement","pages":5,"width":null,"height":null,"sha256":"4ba98322a8cb158d1a330a556289ba8843b35a8e6c3141d3ea56e925ed0ff082","created":"2019-08-30T11:49:37Z","expires":null,"file_type":"pdf","source_url":null,"customWidth":null,"customHeight":null,"access_method":"official_supplement","manually_matched":false}],"article":{"url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11675-y","isbn":null,"issn":null,"year":2019,"eisbn":null,"eissn":"2041-1723","issue":"1","title":"A high-resolution map of non-crossover events reveals impacts of genetic diversity on mammalian meiotic recombination","volume":"10","authors":["Ran Li","Emmanuelle Bitoun","Nicolas Altemose","Robert W Davies","Benjamin Davies","Simon R Myers"],"chapter":null,"journal":"Nature Communications","pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11675-y.pdf","abstract":"During meiotic recombination, homologue-templated repair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) produces relatively few crossovers and many difficult-to-detect non-crossovers. By intercrossing two diverged mouse subspecies over five generations and deep-sequencing 119 offspring, we detect thousands of crossover and non-crossover events genome-wide with unprecedented power and spatial resolution. We find that both crossovers and non-crossovers are strongly depleted at DSB hotspots where the DSB-positioning protein PRDM9 fails to bind to the unbroken homologous chromosome, revealing that PRDM9 also functions to promote homologue-templated repair. Our results show that complex non-crossovers are much rarer in mice than humans, consistent with complex events arising from accumulated non-programmed DNA damage. Unexpectedly, we also find that GC-biased gene conversion is restricted to non-crossover tracts containing only one mismatch. These results demonstrate that local genetic diversity profoundly alters meiotic repair pathway decisions via at least two distinct mechanisms, impacting genome evolution and Prdm9-related hybrid infertility. During meiotic recombination, genetic information is transferred or exchanged between parental chromosome copies. Using a large hybrid mouse pedigree, the authors generated high-resolution maps of these transfer/exchange events and discovered new properties governing their processing and resolution.","pagination":"3900","journal_abbrev":"Nat Commun"},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1038/s41467-019-11675-y"},"item_type":"article","purchased":null,"user_data":{"star":false,"tags":[],"notes":null,"source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1038/s41467-019-11675-y","created":"2019-08-30T11:49:37Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:32Z","createdby":"browser_extension_aa chrome-v2.29","last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"annotations":[],"print_count":0,"sourced_from":0,"active_read_time":null,"has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{"type":"article"},"id":"6b5b2a7a-677c-4f1c-90d4-7b5ee27bf0fe","type":"item","access_data":{},"pdf_hash":"90f4d72056d449808f77f78fe22fd548ef7588924123c8bff1bf41b19eb74988","primary_file_type":"pdf","primary_file_hash":"90f4d72056d449808f77f78fe22fd548ef7588924123c8bff1bf41b19eb74988"},{"seq":19441,"files":[],"article":{"isbn":null,"issn":null,"year":2017,"eisbn":null,"eissn":null,"issue":null,"title":"Correlated patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation across an avian family","volume":null,"authors":["Benjamin Doren","Leonardo Campagna","Barbara Helm","Juan Illera","Irby J Lovette","Miriam Liedvogel"],"chapter":null,"journal":"bioRxiv","abstract":"Comparative studies of genomic differentiation among independent lineages can provide insights into aspects of the speciation process, such as the relative importance of selection and drift in shaping genomic landscapes, the role of genomic regions of high differentiation, and the prevalence of convergent molecular evolution.

A crossover in the PAR is essential for the proper disjunction of X and Y chromosomes in male meiosis, and PAR deletion results in male sterility. This leads the human PAR with the obligatory crossover, PAR1, to having an exceptionally high male crossover rate, which is 17-fold higher than the genome-wide average. However, the mechanism by which this obligatory crossover occurs remains unknown, as does the fine-scale positioning of crossovers across this region. Recent research in mice has suggested that crossovers in PAR may be mediated independently of the protein PRDM9, which localises virtually all crossovers in the autosomes. To investigate recombination in this region, we construct the most fine-scale genetic map containing directly observed crossovers to date using African-American pedigrees. We leverage recombination rates inferred from the breakdown of linkage disequilibrium in human populations and investigate the signatures of DNA evolution due to recombination. Further, we identify direct PRDM9 binding sites using ChIP-seq in human cells. Using these independent lines of evidence, we show that, in contrast with mouse, PRDM9 does localise peaks of recombination in the human PAR1. We find that recombination is a far more rapid and intense driver of sequence evolution in PAR1 than it is on the autosomes. We also show that PAR1 hotspot activities differ significantly among human populations. Finally, we find evidence that PAR1 hotspot positions have changed between human and chimpanzee, with no evidence of sharing among the hottest hotspots. We anticipate that the genetic maps built and validated in this work will aid research on this vital and fascinating region of the genome.","pagination":"e1004503"},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1004503","pmid":"25033397"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"tags":[],"added":null,"notes":"","source":null,"unread":false,"citekey":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1004503","created":"2016-02-02T09:33:49Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:17Z","createdby":null,"last_read":"2018-09-14T07:36:28Z","modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":3,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":0,"active_read_time":"0","has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":"2018-09-14T07:36:28Z","view_count_total":3},"import_data":{},"data_version":1,"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{},"supplement_files":[],"id":"6e81dc39-7ad0-4994-8813-29d51362d687","type":"item","access_data":{}},{"seq":19467,"files":[],"article":{"isbn":null,"issn":"1460-2075","year":2011,"eisbn":null,"eissn":"1460-2075","issue":"5","title":"JTV1 co‐activates FBP to induce USP29 transcription and stabilize p53 in response to oxidative stress","volume":"30","authors":["Juhong Liu","Hye‐Jung Chung","Matthew Vogt","Yetao Jin","Daniela Malide","Liusheng He","Miroslav Dundr","David Levens"],"chapter":null,"journal":"The EMBO Journal","abstract":"At c-myc, the far upstream element binding protein (FBP) and FBP-interacting repressor (FIR) program transcription by looping to RNA polymerase II complexes engaged at the promoter.

Similarity to humans has motivated research into nonhuman primate models, yet few studies of wild primates have investigated immediate causal factors of evolutionarily diverged social behaviors. Neurotransmitter differences have been invoked to explain the distinct behavioral suites of two baboon species in Awash, Ethiopia, which differ markedly in social behavior despite evolutionary propinquity. With this natural experiment, we test the hypothesis that genomic regions associated with monoamine neurotransmitters would be highly differentiated, and we identify a dopamine pathway as an outlier, highlighting the system as a potential cause of species-specific social behaviors. Dopamine levels and resultant variation in impulsivity were likely under differential selection in the species due to social system structure differences, with either brash or circumspect social behavior advantageous to secure mating opportunities depending on the social backdrop. Such comparative studies into the causes of the behavioral agendas that create and interact with social systems are of particular interest, and differences in temperament related to boldness and associated with dopamine variation likely played important roles in the evolution of all social, behaviorally complex animals, including baboons and humans.","pagination":"6178-6181","journal_abbrev":"Proc National Acad Sci"},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1525530113","pmid":"27140612","pmcid":"PMC4896724"},"user_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","item_type":"article","user_data":{"citekey":"10.1073/pnas.1525530113","created":"2021-09-13T16:21:27Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:22Z","createdby":"webapp 4.10.1","modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","has_annotations":false,"unread":true,"last_read":null,"last_read_total":null,"view_count":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{},"id":"b7f2d080-15ac-4b2d-be28-5d7ce01d8b22","type":"item","access_data":{},"user_name":"Kasper Munch","user_email":"kaspermunch@birc.au.dk"},{"seq":19519,"files":[],"article":{"url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/555060","year":2019,"title":"Viruses rule over adaptation in conserved human proteins","authors":["David Castellano","Lawrence H Uricchio","Kasper Munch","David Enard"],"journal":"bioRxiv","abstract":"Abstract Adaptive evolution often involves fast-evolving proteins, and the fastest-evolving proteins in primates include antiviral proteins engaged in an arms race with viruses 1-3 . Even though fast-evolving antiviral proteins are the most studied cases of primate host adaptation against viruses, viruses predominantly interact with host proteins that are broadly conserved between distant species in order to complete their replication cycle 4 . Broadly conserved proteins are generally viewed as playing a negligible role in adaptive evolution. Here, we used a dataset of ~4,500 human proteins known to physically interact with viruses (VIPs for Virus-Interacting Proteins), to test the involvement of broadly conserved proteins in adaptive evolution against viruses. We found that VIPs conserved between animals and fungi have experienced not only high rates of adaption, but also strong adaptive events. Broadly conserved proteins that do not interact with viruses experienced very little adaptation. As a result, the arms race with viruses explains more than 75% of adaptation in the most phylogenetically conserved subset of the human proteome. Our results imply that broadly conserved proteins have played a significant role in adaptation, and that viruses were likely one of very few selective pressures that were able to force the conserved, central pillars of host cellular functions to adapt during evolution.","pagination":"555060","journal_abbrev":"Biorxiv"},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1101/555060"},"user_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","item_type":"article","user_data":{"citekey":"10.1101/555060","created":"2022-09-19T14:56:22Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:23Z","createdby":"webapp 4.12.8","last_read":"2022-10-31T06:44:02Z","modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","has_annotations":false,"unread":false,"last_read_total":"2022-10-31T06:44:02Z","view_count":1,"view_count_total":1},"import_data":{},"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{},"id":"22b592c9-243f-4b94-8c8a-57fedfbdb341","type":"item","access_data":{},"user_name":"Kasper Munch","user_email":"kaspermunch@birc.au.dk"},{"seq":19534,"files":[],"article":{"url":"https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/doi/10.1242/dev.200489/275523/Loss-of-perinuclear-theca-ACTRT1-causes-acrosome","issn":"0950-1991","year":2022,"eissn":"1477-9129","issue":"12","title":"Loss of perinuclear theca ACTRT1 causes acrosome detachment and severe male subfertility","volume":"149","authors":["Xiao-Zhen Zhang","Lin-Lin Wei","Xiao-Hui Zhang","Hui-Juan Jin","Su-Ren Chen"],"journal":"Development","abstract":"The perinuclear theca (PT) is a cytoskeletal element encapsulating the sperm nucleus; however, physiological roles of PT in sperm are largely uncertain.

Furthermore, we engineered Actrt1-knockout (KO) mice to define the functions of ACTRT1. Despite the normal sperm count and motility, Actrt1-KO males were severely subfertile due to a deficiency in fertilization. Loss of ACTRT1 caused a high incidence of malformed heads and detachment of acrosomes from sperm nuclei, which were caused by the loosened acroplaxome structure during spermiogenesis. Furthermore, Actrt1-KO sperm showed reduced ACTL7A and PLCζ protein content as a potential cause of fertilization defects. Moreover, we revealed that ACTRT1 anchors developing acrosomes to the nucleus, likely by interacting with the inner acrosomal membrane protein SPACA1 and the nuclear envelope proteins PARP11 and SPATA46.

Thus sexually dimorphic variation that distinguishes the species may be transmitted between generations in epigenetic form that evades detection by linkage and association.","pagination":null},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1038/mp.2010.92","gsid":"sKVaIhEDayAJ:2335964203847427504","pmid":21430674},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"tags":[],"added":null,"notes":"","source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1038/mp.2010.92","created":"2014-04-16T20:07:09Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:02Z","createdby":"desktop-MacOS10.9.2-2.0.10190","last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":0,"active_read_time":"0","has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"data_version":1,"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{},"supplement_files":null,"id":"7c7b3ac1-b760-a40f-69d2-6c2396ea1e52","type":"item","access_data":{}},{"seq":19262,"files":[],"article":{"isbn":null,"issn":"0036-8075","year":1982,"eisbn":null,"eissn":"1095-9203","issue":null,"title":"The origin of man: a chromosomal pictorial legacy","volume":null,"authors":["J Yunis","O Prakash"],"chapter":null,"journal":"Science","abstract":"","pagination":null},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1126/science.7063861"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"tags":[],"added":null,"notes":"","source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1126/science.7063861","created":"2014-05-19T19:06:38Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:03Z","createdby":"desktop-MacOS10.9.2-2.0.10576","last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":0,"active_read_time":"0","has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"data_version":1,"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{},"supplement_files":null,"id":"6a17b8c2-41c2-edff-cabe-15e0e2f056bc","type":"item","access_data":{}},{"seq":19271,"files":[],"article":{"isbn":null,"issn":"0092-8674","year":2004,"eisbn":null,"eissn":null,"issue":null,"title":"Early decision; meiotic crossover interference prior to stable strand exchange and synapsis.","volume":null,"authors":["Douglas K Bishop","Denise Zickler"],"chapter":null,"journal":"Cell","abstract":"During meiosis, DNA double-strand breaks ultimately yield two types of recombinants: crossovers (CO) and noncrossovers (NCO).

Here we capture and sequence the complete exomes of 12 chimpanzees and present the largest set of protein-coding polymorphism to date. We report extensive adaptive evolution specifically targeting the X chromosome of chimpanzees with as much as 30% of all amino acid replacements being adaptive. Adaptive evolution is barely detectable on the autosomes except for a few striking cases of recent selective sweeps associated with immunity gene clusters. We also find much stronger purifying selection than observed in humans, and in contrast to humans, we find that purifying selection is stronger on the X chromosome than on the autosomes in chimpanzees. We therefore conclude that most adaptive mutations are recessive. We also document dramatically reduced synonymous diversity in the chimpanzee X chromosome relative to autosomes and stronger purifying selection than for the human X chromosome. If similar processes were operating in the human-chimpanzee ancestor as in central chimpanzees today, our results therefore provide an explanation for the much-discussed reduction in the human-chimpanzee divergence at the X chromosome.","pagination":"2054-9"},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1106877109","pmc":"PMC3277544","pmid":22308321,"pmcid":"PMC3277544"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"tags":[],"added":null,"notes":"","source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1073/pnas.1106877109","created":"2015-08-13T08:06:07Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:06Z","createdby":null,"last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":1,"active_read_time":"0","has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"data_version":1,"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{},"supplement_files":null,"id":"5a4cc147-d06e-5e63-35c2-0b51834281e7","type":"item","access_data":{}},{"seq":19698,"files":[{"name":"30303966633461332d303339362d343331322d613465392d396338306534633866626665.pdf","sha1":"b677d693c703797845c599096af31d356b9e7e8b","size":1524775,"type":"article","pages":9,"width":"595.276","height":"782.362","sha256":"faee879e11c8d4498acdc94736fd713393da07f1010a250b59416a5930ef8a85","created":"2020-01-10T21:50:26Z","expires":null,"file_type":"pdf","source_url":null,"customWidth":{"0-8":"595.276"},"customHeight":{"0-8":"782.362"},"access_method":null,"manually_matched":false}],"article":{"url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27360-x","isbn":null,"issn":null,"year":2018,"eisbn":null,"eissn":"2045-2322","issue":"1","month":6,"title":"Male mice with large inversions or deletions of X-chromosome palindrome arms are fertile and express their associated genes during post-meiosis","volume":"8","authors":["Alyssa N Kruger","Quinn Ellison","Michele A Brogley","Emma R Gerlinger","Jacob L Mueller"],"chapter":null,"journal":"Scientific Reports","pdf_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27360-x.pdf","abstract":"Large (\u003e10 kb) palindromic sequences are enriched on mammalian sex chromosomes. In mice, these palindromes harbor gene families (≥2 gene copies) expressed exclusively in post-meiotic testicular germ cells, a time when most single-copy sex-linked genes are transcriptionally repressed. This observation led to the hypothesis that palindromic structures or having ≥2 gene copies enable post-meiotic gene expression. We tested these hypotheses by using CRISPR to precisely engineer large (10’s of kb) inversions and deletions of X-chromosome palindrome arms for two regions that carry the mouse 4930567H17Rik and Mageb5 palindrome gene families. We found that 4930567H17Rik and Mageb5 gene expression is unaffected in mice carrying palindrome arm inversions and halved in mice carrying palindrome arm deletions. We assessed whether palindrome-associated genes were sensitive to reduced expression in mice carrying palindrome arm deletions. Male mice carrying palindrome arm deletions are fertile and show no defects in post-meiotic spermatogenesis. Together, these findings suggest palindromic structures on the sex chromosomes are not necessary for their associated genes to evade post-meiotic transcriptional repression and that these genes are not sensitive to reduced expression levels. Large sex chromosome palindromes may be important for other reasons, such as promoting gene conversion between palindrome arms.","pagination":"8985"},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1038/s41598-018-27360-x","pmid":"29895860"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"tags":[],"notes":null,"source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1038/s41598-018-27360-x","created":"2020-01-10T21:50:26Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:38Z","createdby":"Mobile-iPhone9,313.3-2.83.2.83003","last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":0,"active_read_time":null,"has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{"type":"article"},"id":"009fc4a3-0396-4312-a4e9-9c80e4c8fbfe","type":"item","access_data":{},"pdf_hash":"faee879e11c8d4498acdc94736fd713393da07f1010a250b59416a5930ef8a85","primary_file_type":"pdf","primary_file_hash":"faee879e11c8d4498acdc94736fd713393da07f1010a250b59416a5930ef8a85"},{"seq":19701,"files":[{"name":"30646532333266622d386539652d343633622d623765312d306661636332336237313961.pdf","sha1":"cfa07b03f12d70c679425dc40079467dd9a132dc","size":6393747,"type":"article","pages":35,"width":"612.000","height":"792.000","sha256":"bdabe6868494a2e67874da89e309d08bd26a712ffcc8f69967dedd7020291a3e","created":"2020-01-11T16:05:12Z","expires":null,"file_type":"pdf","source_url":null,"customWidth":{"0-34":"612.000"},"customHeight":{"0-34":"792.000"},"access_method":null,"manually_matched":false}],"article":{"url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/800201v1.abstract","isbn":null,"issn":null,"year":2019,"eisbn":null,"eissn":null,"issue":null,"month":10,"title":"Genetic signatures of evolutionary rescue by a selective sweep","volume":null,"authors":["Matthew M Osmond","Graham Coop"],"chapter":null,"journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/10/10/800201.full.pdf","abstract":"One of the most useful models in population genetics is that of a selective sweep and the consequent hitch-hiking of linked neutral alleles. While variations on this model typically assume constant population size, many instances of strong selection and rapid adaptation in nature may co-occur with complex demography. Here we extend the hitch-hiking model to evolutionary rescue, where adaptation and demography not only co-occur but are intimately entwined. Our results show how this feedback between demography and evolution determines – and restricts – the genetic signatures of evolutionary rescue, and how these differ from the signatures of sweeps in populations of constant size. In particular, we find rescue to harden sweeps from standing variance or new mutation (but not from migration), reduce nucleotide diversity both at the selected site and genome-wide, and increase the range of observed Tajima’s D values. For a given rate of population decline, the feedback between demography and evolution makes all of these differences more dramatic under weaker selection, where bottlenecks are prolonged. Nevertheless, it is likely difficult to infer the co-incident timing of the sweep and bottleneck from these simple signatures, never-mind a feedback between them. Temporal samples spanning contemporary rescue events may offer one way forward.","pagination":"800201"},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1101/800201"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"tags":[],"notes":null,"source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1101/800201","created":"2020-01-11T16:05:12Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:38Z","createdby":"Mobile-iPhone9,313.3-2.83.2.83003","last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":0,"active_read_time":null,"has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{"type":"article"},"id":"0de232fb-8e9e-463b-b7e1-0facc23b719a","type":"item","access_data":{},"pdf_hash":"bdabe6868494a2e67874da89e309d08bd26a712ffcc8f69967dedd7020291a3e","primary_file_type":"pdf","primary_file_hash":"bdabe6868494a2e67874da89e309d08bd26a712ffcc8f69967dedd7020291a3e"},{"seq":19711,"files":[{"name":"36643263376361632d313434642d343631632d396165392d343538363661633163323963.pdf","sha1":"19bec9046d0449c6dde23a73f608a5381bc9ad9e","size":369305,"type":"article","pages":9,"width":"595.276","height":"841.890","sha256":"e11d9280143e59775737d330aa4379aa3c48d6d9dc09fc9795582e9c8f0fadbb","created":"2020-01-25T18:12:27Z","expires":null,"file_type":"pdf","source_url":null,"customWidth":{"0-8":"595.276"},"customHeight":{"0-8":"841.890"},"access_method":null,"manually_matched":false}],"article":{"url":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.1430","isbn":null,"issn":"0962-8452","year":2019,"eisbn":null,"eissn":"1471-2945","issue":"1913","title":"Meiotic drive mechanisms: lessons from Drosophila","volume":"286","authors":["Cécile Courret","Ching-Ho Chang","Kevin Wei","Catherine Montchamp-Moreau","Amanda M Larracuente"],"chapter":null,"journal":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B","abstract":"Meiotic drivers are selfish genetic elements that bias their transmission into gametes, often to the detriment of the rest of the genome. The resulting intragenomic conflicts triggered by meiotic drive create evolutionary arms races and shape genome evolution. The phenomenon of meiotic drive is widespread across taxa but is particularly prominent in the Drosophila genus. Recent studies in Drosophila have provided insights into the genetic origins of drivers and their molecular mechanisms. Here, we review the current literature on mechanisms of drive with an emphasis on sperm killers in Drosophila species. In these systems, meiotic drivers often evolve from gene duplications and targets are generally linked to heterochromatin. While dense in repetitive elements and difficult to study using traditional genetic and genomic approaches, recent work in Drosophila has made progress on the heterochromatic compartment of the genome. Although we still understand little about precise drive mechanisms, studies of male drive systems are converging on common themes such as heterochromatin regulation, small RNA pathways, and nuclear transport pathways. Meiotic drive systems are therefore promising models for discovering fundamental features of gametogenesis.","pagination":null},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1098/rspb.2019.1430","pmid":"31640520"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":true,"tags":[],"notes":null,"source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1098/rspb.2019.1430","created":"2020-01-25T18:12:27Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:39Z","createdby":"Mobile-iPad7,113.2.3-2.83.2.83003","last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":0,"active_read_time":null,"has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{"type":"article"},"id":"6d2c7cac-144d-461c-9ae9-45866ac1c29c","type":"item","access_data":{},"pdf_hash":"e11d9280143e59775737d330aa4379aa3c48d6d9dc09fc9795582e9c8f0fadbb","primary_file_type":"pdf","primary_file_hash":"e11d9280143e59775737d330aa4379aa3c48d6d9dc09fc9795582e9c8f0fadbb"},{"drm":null,"seq":19751,"files":[{"name":"pdf.sciencedirectassets.com 3/11/2020, 10:41:42 AM.pdf","sha1":null,"size":825614,"type":"article","pages":16,"width":null,"height":null,"sha256":"f0e2d7fd34e922637005bdccbd254480dc62c39e0ec1c4258e785dae1f9f7a1b","created":"2020-03-11T09:41:42Z","expires":null,"file_type":"pdf","source_url":null,"customWidth":null,"customHeight":null,"access_method":"personal_library","manually_matched":false}],"article":{"isbn":null,"issn":null,"year":null,"eisbn":null,"eissn":null,"issue":null,"title":"pdf.sciencedirectassets.com 3/11/2020, 10:41:42 AM.pdf","volume":null,"authors":[],"chapter":null,"journal":null,"abstract":"","pagination":null},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{},"item_type":"article","purchased":null,"user_data":{"star":false,"tags":[],"notes":null,"source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"ugl","created":"2020-03-11T09:41:42Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:42Z","createdby":"browser_extension_aa chrome-v2.53","last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":0,"active_read_time":null,"has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{"type":"article"},"id":"20bdf64c-2306-40af-a3e0-9768def87b6f","type":"item","access_data":{},"pdf_hash":"f0e2d7fd34e922637005bdccbd254480dc62c39e0ec1c4258e785dae1f9f7a1b","primary_file_type":"pdf","primary_file_hash":"f0e2d7fd34e922637005bdccbd254480dc62c39e0ec1c4258e785dae1f9f7a1b"},{"seq":19345,"files":[],"article":{"isbn":null,"issn":null,"year":2001,"eisbn":null,"eissn":null,"issue":null,"title":"Probabilistic divergence measures for detecting interspecies recombination","volume":null,"authors":["D Husmeier","F Wright"],"chapter":null,"journal":null,"abstract":"... hypoth- esis H0 that no recombination event has occurred with the alternative hypothesis H1 ... where\nNk(t) denotes the number of times a tree has been found to have topology k ...

In the presence of gene flow, chromosomal rearrangements such as inversions are thought to promote divergence and facilitate speciation by suppressing recombination. Using a combination of genetic crosses, phenotyping of a trait underlying ecological isolation, and population genetic analysis of wild populations, we set out to determine whether evidence supports a role for recombination suppressors during speciation between the Z and E strains of European corn borer moth (Ostrinia nubilalis). Our results are consistent with the presence of an inversion that has contributed to accumulation of ecologically adaptive alleles and genetic differentiation across roughly 20% of the Ostrinia sex chromosome (~4 Mb). Patterns in Ostrinia suggest that chromosomal divergence may involve two separate phases—one driving its transient origin through local adaptation and one determining its stable persistence through differential introgression. As the evolutionary rate of rearrangements in lepidopteran genomes appears to be one of the fastest among eukaryotes, structural mutations may have had a disproportionate role during adaptive divergence and speciation in Ostrinia and in other moths and butterflies.","pagination":"593-600"},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1038/hdy.2014.128","pmid":"25626887","pmcid":"PMC4434251"},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"tags":[],"added":null,"notes":"","source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1038/hdy.2014.128","created":"2016-06-22T20:40:48Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:44:13Z","createdby":"Mobile-iPhone5,29.3.2-2.00.2.0004","last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron 4.35.2227","view_count":null,"print_count":0,"sourced_from":0,"active_read_time":"0","has_annotations":false,"last_read_total":null,"view_count_total":0},"import_data":{},"data_version":1,"collection_id":"ff394a98-20f7-4882-871c-840e9f73d65b","custom_metadata":{},"supplement_files":null,"id":"5309cb55-38dc-4ff7-b47b-d1534ae157e5","type":"item","access_data":{}},{"seq":19057,"files":[],"article":{"isbn":null,"issn":"1066-5277","year":2001,"eisbn":null,"eissn":null,"issue":"4","title":"Detection of recombination in DNA multiple alignments with hidden Markov models.","volume":"8","authors":["D Husmeier","F Wright"],"chapter":null,"journal":"Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology","abstract":"Conventional phylogenetic tree estimation methods assume that all sites in a DNA multiple alignment have the same evolutionary history. This assumption is violated in data sets from certain bacteria and viruses due to recombination, a process that leads to the creation of mosaic sequences from different strains and, if undetected, causes systematic errors in phylogenetic tree estimation. In the current work, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is employed to detect recombination events in multiple alignments of DNA sequences. The emission probabilities in a given state are determined by the branching order (topology) and the branch lengths of the respective phylogenetic tree, while the transition probabilities depend on the global recombination probability. The present study improves on an earlier heuristic parameter optimization scheme and shows how the branch lengths and the recombination probability can be optimized in a maximum likelihood sense by applying the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The novel algorithm is tested on a synthetic benchmark problem and is found to clearly outperform the earlier heuristic approach. The paper concludes with an application of this scheme to a DNA sequence alignment of the argF gene from four Neisseria strains, where a likely recombination event is clearly detected.","pagination":"401-27"},"deleted":false,"ext_ids":{"doi":"10.1089/106652701752236214","pmid":11571075},"item_type":"article","user_data":{"star":false,"tags":[],"added":null,"notes":"","source":null,"unread":true,"citekey":"10.1089/106652701752236214","created":"2015-08-13T08:06:07Z","modified":"2023-05-07T21:43:43Z","createdby":null,"last_read":null,"modifiedby":"desktop_electron
